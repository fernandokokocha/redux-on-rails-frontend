# Redux on Rails

## Usage

`npm run watch` and simultaneously `npm run server` - uses `webpack-dev-server` to keep generating live preview of the app.

`npm run build` - builds the app just once. Not recommended.

## Tests (Jest, Enzyme)

`npm run test`

## Code style (JSCS)

`npm run style:check` for checkup only.

`npm run style:fix` for also fixing what can be fixed.
